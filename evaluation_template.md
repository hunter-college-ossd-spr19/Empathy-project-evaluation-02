Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open. Take the twenty most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported. Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.<br><br>
Since there is no history of any pull requests being closed, pull requests seemingly remain unanswered forever.
<br><br>

### Summary

Empathy is not very active and is not a good choice as a project. The average wait time for issues was a whopping **23 MONTHS**. This is an insane amount to wait especially when users might want usability upgrades. This is compounded by the fact that only two issues have been closed within the last six months. Meanwhile, when issues were actually closed, they had no comments on them unless they were 9 months old. Pull requests seem to "remain unanswered forever" which really puts a spotlight on how this project might possibly be dead.
Overall, this seems like a dead end project. With 8 contributors dominating this project you would think more would be done. This can mean a couple of things. First, the code is too difficult to fix. This could be the answer as to why 8 contributors seemed to have such low numbers. Second, the project is abandoned. This can be seen with the recent lack of activity in the comment sections for issues. Either way, there could be many reasons as to why this project is reaching its end but it is not a good project to join as an outsider.
